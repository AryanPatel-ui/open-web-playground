Here’s a **comprehensive contributing guide** you can include in your repository’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` file 👇

# 🧭 Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🎉
Follow these steps to ensure a smooth contribution process.

---

## 🪞 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub.
2. Click **Fork** (top-right corner).
   This creates a copy under your GitHub account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
4. Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
5. Add the original repository as a remote source:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<original-owner>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
6. To keep your fork up to date:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

---

## 🌿 2. Create a New Branch

Always work on a separate branch for each feature or bug fix.

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-stopwatch
```

To switch between branches:

```bash
git checkout main
```

## 💻 3. Coding Standards & Best Practices

Please maintain **clean, consistent, and readable code**.

### 🧩 General Guidelines

* Follow consistent naming conventions:

  * **Variables & functions:** `snake_case` (e.g., `calculate_sum`)
  * **Classes:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `StopwatchApp`)
  * **Constants:** `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_LIMIT`)
* Use **meaningful commit messages** (see below).
* Add comments and docstrings for clarity.
* Avoid hardcoding values — use constants or config variables.
* Remove unnecessary prints and debug logs.
* Keep code modular — avoid long functions or scripts.

### 🧠 Commit Message Format

Use this convention for clear history:

```
<type>: <short summary>
```

**Example:**

```
feat: add dice rolling simulator
fix: correct stopwatch time format
docs: update contributing guide
refactor: clean quick merge sort code
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## 🚀 4. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. Stage and commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add stopwatch app"
   ```
2. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```
3. Go to your fork on GitHub and click **“Compare & pull request.”**
4. Write a clear PR description:

   * What problem does this fix or feature add?
   * Any dependencies or special instructions?
   * Screenshots (if UI-related)
5. Submit the PR to the **main branch** of the original repository.
6. Wait for review and make requested changes if needed.

---

## 🐞 5. Issue Reporting Guidelines

If you find a bug or want to request a feature:

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in the repository.
2. Click **“New Issue.”**
3. Use a clear and descriptive title.
4. Provide the following details:

   * Steps to reproduce (if it’s a bug)
   * Expected vs. actual behavior
   * Screenshots or logs (if applicable)
   * Your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)

**Example:**

```
**Title:** Stopwatch not resetting after stop

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start stopwatch
2. Stop stopwatch
3. Press reset

**Expected:** Timer should reset to 00:00
**Actual:** Timer freezes

**Environment:** macOS, Python 3.10
```

## 🤝 6. Need Help?

If you’re stuck:

* Check existing **Issues** and **Discussions**
* Ask politely for help in your PR or issue thread
* Read project documentation and code comments
